# Candidate Tester

As a part of LC101 I was tasked with evaluating a mock pool of applications for an astronaut training program and creating a quick quiz to help select the best candidates.

## Requirements

1) Ask the candidate to enter their name
2) Use a loop to ask five questions, one at a time, to the candidate
3) Collect the candidate's answers
4) Check those answers for accuracy (case insensitive equality check)
5) Calculate the candidate's overall percentage
6) Determine if the candidate did well enough to enter our program (need >= 80% to pass)
7) Display the results
